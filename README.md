###Overview
Calibrates aerial camera models and constructs 3D models from video sequences as well applications for 3D models such as change detection. 

### Cloning

1. Install and update CentOS 7
2. Install cuda and git-lfs (don't forget to run `git lfs install`!)
3. `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone --recursive https://github.com/ngageoint/voxel-globe`
4. `cd {git_repo}`
5. `echo "https://vsiro:VSIreadonly1@vsi-ri.visualstudio.com" > .pw~`
6. `git config credential.helper "store --file .pw~"`
7. `git lfs pull`

### Building

1. `./install.bat`. You need to say yes to everything except the `run setup` 
question at least once. 

The `run setup` question is important for creating users and setting permissions 
when running in deployment mode. It will also set the firewall rules too. If 
you say no to `run setup`, you can individually choose to setup any of these 3 
steps. They change permissions for deployment, and make development difficult.

### Configuring voxel-globe

There are many variables that can be added to `local_vip.env`, but the most common
include

```
export VIP_IMAGE_SERVER_PORT=8443
export VIP_IMAGE_SERVER_HOST=local.myserver.com
export VIP_IMAGE_SERVER_PROTOCOL=https

export VIP_HTTPD_PORT=8080
export VIP_HTTPD_SSL_PORT=8443
export VIP_HTTPD_SERVER_NAME=${VIP_IMAGE_SERVER_HOST}

```

### Starting voxel-globe

1. `./daemon.bat all start`

If during install, `run setup` was selected, then run `./daemon all start` as root

### Stopping voxel-globe

1. `./daemon.bat all stop`

If during install, `run setup` was selected, then run `./daemon all stop` as root
