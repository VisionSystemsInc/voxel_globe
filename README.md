###Overview
Calibrates aerial camera models and constructs 3D models from video sequences as well applications for 3D models such as change detection. 

### Cloning

Due to using a privet git-lfs server, cloning the repo is less than trivial

1. Install git lfs (https://git-lfs.github.com/) which requires git 1.8.2 or newer
2. `git lfs init`
1. `mkdir voxel_globe`
2. `cd voxel_globe`
3. `git init .`
4. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ngageoint/voxel-globe.git`
5. `git fetch`
6. `git config lfs.url {private_lfs_repo}`
7. Install custom cert if needed for lfs server (typically with `update-ca-trust`)
8. Enable git password caching (easiest is `git config --global credential.helper cache`)
9. `git lfs pull` until no errors
8. `git checkout master`
9. `git submodule init`
10. `git submodule update`
11. ./install.bat
