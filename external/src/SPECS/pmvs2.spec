%description
PMVS is a multi-view stereo software that takes a set of images and camera parameters, then reconstructs 3D structure of an object or a scene visible in the images. Only rigid structure is reconstructed, in other words, the software automatically ignores non-rigid objects such as pedestrians in front of a building. The software outputs a set of oriented points instead of a polygonal (or a mesh) model, where both the 3D coordinate and the surface normal are estimated at each oriented point. This is the second version of the software (a link to the first version with a gallery) distributed under GPL. The software is 64-bit compatible.

PMVS2 was developped when Yasutaka Furukawa was a graduate student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Prof. Jean Ponce, who was affiliated with University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure. Further modifications and enhancements were added when Yasutaka Furukawa was a postdoc at University of Washington.
